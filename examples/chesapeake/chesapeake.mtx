% 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge:
%
% http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/index.shtml
%
% As stated on their main website (
% http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/ ), the "DIMACS Implementation
% Challenges address questions of determining realistic algorithm
% performance where worst case analysis is overly pessimistic and
% probabilistic models are too unrealistic: experimentation can provide
% guides to realistic algorithm performance where analysis fails."
%
% For the 10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge, the two related
% problems of graph partitioning and graph clustering were chosen.
% Graph partitioning and graph clustering are among the aforementioned
% questions or problem areas where theoretical and practical results
% deviate significantly from each other, so that experimental outcomes
% are of particular interest.
%
% Problem Motivation
%
% Graph partitioning and graph clustering are ubiquitous subtasks in
% many application areas. Generally speaking, both techniques aim at
% the identification of vertex subsets with many internal and few
% external edges. To name only a few, problems addressed by graph
% partitioning and graph clustering algorithms are:
%
%     * What are the communities within an (online) social network?
%     * How do I speed up a numerical simulation by mapping it
%         efficiently onto a parallel computer?
%     * How must components be organized on a computer chip such that
%         they can communicate efficiently with each other?
%     * What are the segments of a digital image?
%     * Which functions are certain genes (most likely) responsible
%         for?
%
% Challenge Goals
%
%     * One goal of this Challenge is to create a reproducible picture
%         of the state-of-the-art in the area of graph partitioning
%         (GP) and graph clustering (GC) algorithms. To this end we
%         are identifying a standard set of benchmark instances and
%         generators.
%
%     * Moreover, after initiating a discussion with the community, we
%         would like to establish the most appropriate problem
%         formulations and objective functions for a variety of
%         applications.
%
%     * Another goal is to enable current researchers to compare their
%         codes with each other, in hopes of identifying the most
%         effective algorithmic innovations that have been proposed.
%
%     * The final goal is to publish proceedings containing results
%         presented at the Challenge workshop, and a book containing
%         the best of the proceedings papers.
%
% Problems Addressed
%
% The precise problem formulations need to be established in the course
% of the Challenge. The descriptions below serve as a starting point.
%
%     * Graph partitioning:
%
%       The most common formulation of the graph partitioning problem
%       for an undirected graph G = (V,E) asks for a division of V into
%       k pairwise disjoint subsets (partitions) such that all
%       partitions are of approximately equal size and the edge-cut,
%       i.e., the total number of edges having their incident nodes in
%       different subdomains, is minimized. The problem is known to be
%       NP-hard.
%
%     * Graph clustering:
%
%       Clustering is an important tool for investigating the
%       structural properties of data. Generally speaking, clustering
%       refers to the grouping of objects such that objects in the same
%       cluster are more similar to each other than to objects of
%       different clusters. The similarity measure depends on the
%       underlying application. Clustering graphs usually refers to the
%       identification of vertex subsets (clusters) that have
%       significantly more internal edges (to vertices of the same
%       cluster) than external ones (to vertices of another cluster).
%
% There are 10 data sets in the DIMACS10 collection:
%
% Kronecker:  synthetic graphs from the Graph500 benchmark
% dyn-frames: frames from a 2D dynamic simulation
% Delaunay:   Delaunay triangulations of random points in the plane
% coauthor:   citation and co-author networks
% streets:    real-world street networks
% Walshaw:    Chris Walshaw's graph partitioning archive
% matrix:     graphs from the UF collection (not added here)
% random:     random geometric graphs (random points in the unit square)
% clustering: real-world graphs commonly used as benchmarks
% numerical:  graphs from numerical simulation
%
% Some of the graphs already exist in the UF Collection.  In some cases,
% the original graph is unsymmetric, with values, whereas the DIMACS
% graph is the symmetrized pattern of A+A'.  Rather than add duplicate
% patterns to the UF Collection, a MATLAB script is provided at
% http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/dimacs10 which downloads
% each matrix from the UF Collection via UFget, and then performs whatever
% operation is required to convert the matrix to the DIMACS graph problem.
% Also posted at that page is a MATLAB code (metis_graph) for reading the
% DIMACS *.graph files into MATLAB.
%
%
% clustering:  Clustering Benchmarks
%
% These real-world graphs are often used as benchmarks in the graph
% clustering and community detection communities.  All but 4 of the 27
% graphs already appear in the UF collection in other groups.  The
% DIMACS10 version is always symmetric, binary, and with zero-free
% diagonal.  The version in the UF collection may not have those
% properties, but in those cases, if the pattern of the UF matrix
% is symmetrized and the diagonal removed, the result is the DIMACS10
% graph.
